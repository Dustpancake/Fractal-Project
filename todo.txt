map using image.py
	- export file with "transform{}.txt".format(i)
			i is a count for the file
	exit(i) from python

use system(); calls in cpp to produce the transform{}.txt
read in the exit code to get the file number

find map for n triangles given from image.py

return IFSystem loaded with the transforms and probabilities

mirroring the transforms for symmetry
probabilites related to the n triangle transforms

+ add weighted vector for frame transform
